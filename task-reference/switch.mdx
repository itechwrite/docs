description: 'Task reference for the switch task.'

The switch task is used for conditional branching logic. It represents `if...then...else` or `switch...case` statements in programming, and can be used for any situation where different tasks have to be executed based on different conditions.

A switch task evaluates an `expression`, which could be a simple input parameter key or a complex JavaScript expression, and matches the `expression` output with the name of each switch case. The appropriate tasks are executed based on the matching branch, which contains a sequence of tasks to be executed. The default branch will be executed if no matching branches are found.
